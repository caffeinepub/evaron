  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive EVRON website redesign with most requirements satisfied. The implementation includes new Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy pages, updated product specifications with detailed features and warranty information, reordered sections (Products before About), contact form with phone field, footer with navigation links, and premium corporate styling with green (#2ecc71) branding. The backend was updated to support the phone field with migration logic. However, several requirements related to image generation and specific visual elements cannot be verified from code alone.",
